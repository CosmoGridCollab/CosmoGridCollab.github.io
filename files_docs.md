# Available data products

For each simulation, we store:

- raw simulation lightcone particle count maps stored at Healpix nside=2048 up to z<3.5 (69 shells per simulation),
- halo catalog snapshots created using the friends-of-friends halo finder, with halo mass of M = 10^12 MâŠ™, at every time step,
- projected full sky weak lensing, galaxy density, and intrinsic alignments maps for a Stage-III forecast, including baryonification, at the nside=512,
- projected KiDS-1000 lensing and intrinsic alignment maps with grid extended with baryonic feedback parameters, from Fluri et al. 2022.
