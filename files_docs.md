## Available data products

For each simulation, we store:

- raw simulation lightcone particle count maps stored at Healpix nside=2048 up to z<3.5 (69 shells per simulation),
- halo catalog snapshots created using the friends-of-friends halo finder, with halo mass of M = 10^12 MâŠ™, at every time step,
- projected full sky weak lensing, galaxy density, and intrinsic alignments maps for a Stage-III forecast, including baryonification, at the nside=512,
- projected KiDS-1000 lensing and intrinsic alignment maps with grid extended with baryonic feedback parameters, in the TFRecords format, from Fluri et al. 2022.


## Simulation files structure

The CosmoGrid directory tree follows this structure:

`CosmoGrid/dataset_type/simulation_set/cosmology/realization/`

where:

- `dataset_type` are the availabe datasets, and currently contain `raw`, `stage3_forecast`. The `raw` dataset contains the raw data used to create other sets.

- `simulation_set`:  there are three simulation sets `grid`, `fiducial` and `benchmarks`

- `cosmology`: each directory contains simulations for a given cosmological parameter set

- `realization`: each independent or quasi-independent realization for the given cosmology. This can be from a single, replicated N-body run, or using the shell permutation scheme


## Simulation metadata

File `CosmoGridV1_metainfo.h5` contains metadata useful for working with the simulaitons: cosmological parameters, random seeds, file paths, boundaries of shells, etc.


#### Simulations and input parameters

Dataset `simulations` contains a list of all unique simulation runs, divided by `simulation_set`. 
Dataset `parameters` contains a list of all unique cosmology input parameters. 
The colums in these datasets are as follows, with `parameters` containing only a relevant sub-set of them:

#### Shell information

The dataset `shell_info` contains information about shell boundaries for each simulation. Inside this dataset one should follow the CosmoGridV1 file structure, for example `shell_info/CosmoGrid/raw/grid/cosmo_203124`. These dataset names contain the `raw` key, but it can be replaced by the relevant other set. These entries contain tables with the following fields:

| column                                                | data type | content       |
| -------------                                         | ----------| ------------- |
| shell_id    |   i4  |  index of the shell, lowest redshift first   |
| lower_z     |   f4  |  redshift of the lower edge                  |
| upper_z     |   f4  |  redshift of the upper edge                  |
| lower_com   |   f4  |  comoving distance to the lower edge         |
| upper_com   |   f4  |  comoving distance to the upper edge         |
| shell_com   |   f4  |  comoving distance to the center             |


## Simulation datasets

Here we describe the available simulations datasets. The main one is the `raw` dataset. It was created during the Fluri et al. 2022 (F22) project for the KiDS-1000 analysis, but can be used for other new projects.

### Raw lightcone shells

The raw lightcone shells are stored in `CosmoGrid/raw` and contain: raw shells with nside=2048, snapshot halo catalogs, full sky shells at nside=512 with and without baryonification. The raw grid has been assigned baryon feedback parameters as in F22, but one can re-do this and apply a new different baryon feedback model, if needed.

### Stage-III forecast probe maps 

Probe maps that can be used for making forecasts for Stage-3 large scale structure surveys are stored in `CosmoGrid/stage3_forecast` and condain: full sky projected weak lensing, intrinsic alignment, and galaxy clustering maps at nside=512 for a Stage-III survey forecast. 
This data is described in [Kacprzak et al. 2022](www.arxiv.org/???).

### KiDS-1000 weak lensing analysis data

The data used by Fluri et al. 2022 for the KiDS-1000 analysis with deep learning is stored in `CosmoGrid/KiDS1000_data_products`, and contains:  KiDS-1000 lensing maps at nside=512, with and without baryonification, pre-processed noise maps that were used to train and evaluate the networks. 
This data is described in [Fluri et al. 2022](www.arxiv.org/abs/2201.07771). It is stored in the [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord) format and requires decoding. Additionally, only the relevant patches are stored. For the grid, we provide 250 `tfrecord` files named `grid_data_{num:03d}.tfrecord`, where `num` corresponds to the file number. Each file contains the samples from 10 cosmological parameter combinations and their labels used for the evaluations of the networks used in [Fluri et al. 2022](www.arxiv.org/abs/2201.07771). We provide these sample with or without applied baryonification. The fiducial maps are split into signal only patches with or without applied baryonification and pure noise maps that were used for training or evaluation. Furthermore, a single sample of a fiducial file contains the maps of all delta simulations with the same seed to alleviate the calculations of the derivatives. To decode the files we provide the `read_TFR.py` script that implements the following functions:

```python
def get_fidu_dset(fname, baryon=False):
    """
    Returns a dataset of a fiducial TFRecord file
    :param fname: file name to decode
    :param baryon: If baryonification was applied to this file
    :return: A tensorflow dataset where each sample is a dictionary containing either 15 (if baryon=False)
             or 19 elements (if baryon=True). Each entry is named "patch_{num}" and has the shape
             (149504, 10) where the first dimension indicates the pixels in NEST ordering and the second
             dimension the shear field with the first 5 entries corresponding to gamma_1 of the five
             redshift bins followed by gamma_2. The ordering of the patches is:
             fiducial, -delta omega_m, +delta omega_m, -delta sigma_8, +delta sigma_8
             -delta h_0, +delta h_0, -delta omega_b, +delta omega_b,
             -delta n_s, +delta n_s, -delta w_0, +delta w_0,
             -delta A_IA, +delta A_IA, -delta log10M_c, +delta log10M_c,
             -delta nu, +delta nu
             where the baryonification parameter patches (log10M_c and nu) are only included if baryon=True.
    """
    
def get_grid_dset(fname, baryon=False):
    """
    Returns a dataset of a gird TFRecord file
    :param fname: file name to decode
    :param baryon: If baryonification was applied to this file
    :return: A tensorflow dataset containing two elements. The first element has a shape of (149504, 10)
             where the first dimension indicates the pixels in NEST ordering and the second
             dimension the shear field with the first 5 entries corresponding to gamma_1 of the five
             redshift bins followed by gamma_2. The second element is the label of the cosmology having a
             length of 9 if baryon=False and 11 if baryon=True. The order of the label is:
             omega_m, sigma_8, h_0, omega_b, n_s, w_0, A_IA, log10M_c, nu, omega_nu, A_s
             where the baryonification parameters (log10M_c and nu) are only included if baryon=True.
    """
    
def get_noise_dset(fname):
    """
    Returns a dataset of a noise TFRecord file
    :param fname: file name to decode
    :return: A tensorflow dataset containing an element of a noise map with a shape of (149504, 10)
             where the first dimension indicates the pixels in NEST ordering and the second
             dimension the shear field with the first 5 entries corresponding to gamma_1 of the five
             redshift bins followed by gamma_2.
    """
```

Additionally we provide a file `pixel_indices_NEST.npy` containing the indices of the patches such that they can be maped onto full sky maps, as the following snippet illustrates:

```python
from read_TFR import get_fidu_dset
import healpy as hp
import numpy as np

# load the dataset
fname = ...
dset = get_fidu_dset(fname)

# get the first element
b = next(iter(dset))
    
# load the pixel indices
pix = np.load("pixel_indices_NEST.npy")

# create and fill the map, note that the map is in NEST ordering
m = np.zeros(hp.nside2npix(512))
m[pix] = b.numpy()[:,5] # gamma_1 of z-bin 5

# plot
hp.mollview(m, nest=True)
```
