## Available data products

For each simulation, we store:

- raw simulation lightcone particle count maps stored at Healpix nside=2048 up to z<3.5 (69 shells per simulation),
- halo catalog snapshots created using the friends-of-friends halo finder, with halo mass of M = 10^12 MâŠ™, at every time step,
- projected full sky weak lensing, galaxy density, and intrinsic alignments maps for a Stage-III forecast, including baryonification, at the nside=512,
- projected KiDS-1000 lensing and intrinsic alignment maps with grid extended with baryonic feedback parameters, from Fluri et al. 2022.


## Simulation files structure

The CosmoGrid directory tree follows this structure:

`CosmoGrid/dataset_type/simulation_set/cosmology/realization/`

where:

- `dataset_type` are the availabe datasets, and currently contain `raw`, `stage3_forecast` or `KiDS1000_data_products`. the `raw` dataset contains the raw data used to create other sets.

- `simulation_set`:  there are three simulation sets `grid`, `fiducial` and `benchmarks`

- `cosmology`: each directory contains simulations for a given cosmological parameter set

- `realization`: each independent or quasi-independent realization for the given cosmology. This can be from a single, replicated N-body run, or using the shell permutation scheme

## Simulation datasets

Here we describe the available simulations datasets. The main one is the `raw` dataset. It was created during the Fluri et al. 2022 (F22) project for the KiDS-1000 analysis, but can be used for other new projects.

### Raw lightcone shells

The raw lightcone shells are stored in `CosmoGrid/raw` and contain: raw shells with nside=2048, snapshot halo catalogs, full sky shells at nside=512 with and without baryonification. The raw grid has been assigned baryon feedback parameters as in F22, but one can re-do this and apply a new different baryon feedback model, if needed.
