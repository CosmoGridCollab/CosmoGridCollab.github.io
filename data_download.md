# Data download

The data is hosted at ETH Zurich and is freely available for download for anyone.
The download only possible via the [Globus](https://www.globus.org) service, with CILogin.
See this [manual page](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/) to learn how to get started with Globus.

## Check availability at your HPC center

Before transferring CosmoGrid, it may be worth to check if it has been already transfered to your HPC facility in the past.
The copy so far exists at NERSC. Please contact us to obtain access.

You can use your academic login for institutions available in the CILogin, or with other ID providers. Here I use "ETH Zurich" as it is my organization.
